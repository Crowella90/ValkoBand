Valko Band
=========

This is the testing and development area for the Valko website.

More details regarding the development phase will be posted here with time in the appropriate master folder. I will at the best of times keep updating here with progress on the site. I ask people that view this to pull up whatever issues possible and report them using the issues system. I will get to them as often as I can as well as detail each change as much as humanly possible. If you would like to offer solutions to some issues as well that would be greatly appreciated but please ensure to keep all communication channels with me. When I deem the project sufficiently complete, I will publish it on a domain.

The purpose of using github (and github.io) is to keep the development process descriptive and engage others to help and assist when required or deemed neccessary.

Valko is an indie-rock band from the Central Coast, NSW, Australia. I am the bassist in the band and responsible for the creation and management of the website. Valko will soon be releasing an EP so having a well constructed digital media profile is instrumental in assisting the success of the band.

Short Term Goal
=========
The current short term goal for the project include
- Getting a functional static site to render in HTML/CSS/JS (if required) on all devices
- Set and establish the feel of the site

Future Goals
========= 
Obviously there is a lot of work to go, things to do once the short term goal is achieved include
- Dynamically controlled content, establish the framework for it
- Providing a functional way for the band members to add/remove/modify content
- Get the website to be present within search engines (make it more readable for robots)
- Connect the website with as much of our social media content as possible
- Provide functionality for users to interact and share content
- Publish it!

Extra Targets
=========
A few extra things we can plan down the line include
- Providing a merch/e-commerce shop for users to purchase merchandise/physical EP copies
- Community based discussion group
 
Despite there being a long way to go, I believe the future goals at least can be achieved in a short time and will definitely be up and running before the EP is released. It'll take some time and effort but the reward should be good.
