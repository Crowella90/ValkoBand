Valko Band
=========

This is the testing and development area for the Valko website.

More details regarding the development phase will be posted here with time in the appropriate master folder. I will at the best of times keep updating here with progress on the site. I ask people that view this to pull up whatever issues possible and report them using the issues system. I will get to them as often as I can as well as detail each change as much as humanly possible. If you would like to offer solutions to some issues as well that would be greatly appreciated but please ensure to keep all communication channels with me. When I deem the project sufficiently complete, I will publish it on a domain.

The purpose of using github (and github.io) is to keep the development process descriptive and engage others to help and assist when required or deemed neccessary.

Valko is an indie-rock band from the Central Coast, NSW, Australia. I am the bassist in the band and responsible for the creation and management of the website. Valko will soon be releasing an EP so having a well constructed digital media profile is instrumental in assisting the success of the band.
