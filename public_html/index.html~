						<h3>BAND LINEUP ANNOUNCEMENT</h3>
						<h4>4th August, 2014</h4>
						<br>Hey guys!!
						<br>Sorry for the extended silence as of late but we have great news to announce to you. As of today we can fully announce our official and final lineup. Jess Beazley will be joining us on lead vocals alongside Adam Crowell who will be on Bass guitar.
						<br>
						<br>This means we will be resuming the tracking of vocals for the EP so we can FINALLY get something to you guys. We just want to thank everyone for their patience and support through Cardi losing his voice and we're just excited to be back on track and playing music again!
						<br>
						<br>Much love,
						<br>
						<br>Valko
						<br>(Cam, Cardi, Jared, Adam and Jess)

						<h3>EP UPDATE</h3>
						<h4>21st July, 2014</h4>
						<br>The EP was to be released at the end of this month but due to health issues with his vocals, Matt is no longer able to continue as the lead vocalist so he is now our official drummer.
						<br>
						<br>Valko is currently looking for a new vocalist if anyone is interested. Send us a msg and a reference of you singing! We'll organize the rest ;)
	We're still very excited to finish everything and start playing shows so with your help, maybe we can make it happen ASAP!
						<br>
						<br>(We would love you guys to share this around :) it would mean alot to us)
